## Blog

Over the years, I've written some blog posts about research and data collection, most of it on [Prolific's blog](https://blog.prolific.ac/). Here are some of my personal highlights.

#### How many participants to recruit?

In [one of my earliest posts](https://blog.prolific.ac/how-many-participants-shall-i-recruit-can-i-oversample-my-study/) in 2015 I asked: How many participants should a researcher recruit for any given study, and is it possible to "oversample" a study? I received very helpful responses from science experts Joe Simmons, Brian Nosek, Eli Finkel, and Daniël Lakens via Twitter. Conclusion: It's not possible to "oversample" a study because more data makes your estimate more precise. But, because you have resource constraints, you will have to make a call as to what sample size is meaningful for your study (given a couple of parameters, like the magnitude of the effect that you expect).

####  Do not fear zombie science


I also really enjoyed writing [this piece](https://blog.prolific.ac/do-not-fear-zombie-scientists-and-their-zombie-papers/) about "zombie science" in October 2016. This post helped me work through some of the major issues that my field was (and still is) facing around replication and the toxic publish-or-perish culture. Let's face it, science is broken in many ways, and in my opinion the biggest problem lies in the [perverse incentives structures](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.171511). If publications in top journals – rather than producing top tier science – are rewarded and prized, then you inevitably end up with researchers optimizing for publications rather than rigorous, meaningful research. 

####  How to do great research?

I'm especially proud of [this more recent piece](https://blog.prolific.ac/how-to-do-great-research/) because it reflects how we at Prolific started developing our company mission. We realized that we wanted to empower great research by democratizing access to high quality data from people around the world. And we figured that to empower great research, we need to qualify what "great research" is in the first place. So, we launched our [Best Practice Guide](https://helpcentre.prolific.ac/hc/en-gb/categories/360000850653-Prolific-s-Best-Practice-Guide), guiding researchers through all key phases of the research process.
